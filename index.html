      <h2> Goal </h2>
      <p>The goal of this project to create a virtual reality application, such as Ping Pong, using Opti-Track Motive with the virtual reality system (already set up in xLab, UPenn) having 5 grayscale camera sensors and IR emitters; and finally integrate it with software technologies such as VRUI and physics engine like LiquidFun that are built for virtual reality based applications.</p>
      <h2> Motivation </h2>
      <ul>
      	<li><b>Beneficial :- </b>There are lot of areas where virtual reality can be beneficial, for example, building advanced games, improving teaching practices, entertainment etc. We plan to explore, if not all, atleast some of them.</li>
        <li><b>Challenging :- </b>The field of virtual reality has been evolving recently and very few resources are available for developers. That is why we find it very challenging and we hope to contribute something to the VR community.</li>
  		<li><b>Exciting :- </b> Developing a virtual reality application is definitely exciting because you get to play with something that is not real. The words "Creating Virtual Reality" should be sufficient enough to understand the excitement behind it.</li>
  	  </ul>
      <h2> Project Components </h2>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Virtual Wall setup</b> having 5 grayscale cameras and IR emitters</li>
        <li><b>Rigid bodies</b> designed using retro-reflective markers</li>
  		<li><b>OptiTrack Motive</b> for collecting and processing data of rigid bodies</li>
  		<li><b>VRUI toolkit</b> to develop the virtual reality application</li>
  		<li><b>LiquidFun physics engine</b> to add VR effects</li>
	  </ul>
